# Main Module Documentation

## Overview

The `main.py` file serves as the entry point for the SISA (Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, Aggregated) malware detection system. It provides functions for training the model, making predictions, and performing machine unlearning.

## Functions

### training

```python
def training(logger):
```

Trains the SISA model.

#### Process:
1. Initializes a SISA object
2. Divides the data into shards and slices
3. Preprocesses the data
4. Trains the model using the SISA algorithm

### prediction

```python
def prediction(logger):
```

Makes predictions using the trained SISA model.

#### Process:
1. Initializes a SISA object
2. Performs majority voting for prediction
3. Explains the predictions

### unlearning

```python
def unlearning(logger):
```

Unlearns specific data points from the SISA model.

#### Process:
1. Initializes a SISA object
2. Performs machine unlearning to remove the influence of specific data points

### set_log

```python
def set_log() -> logging.Logger:
```

Sets up and configures the logger for the detector.

#### Returns:
- logging.Logger: The configured logger object

## Main Execution

The main execution block:
1. Sets up logging
2. Reads the configuration
3. Based on the configuration, calls either `training()`, `prediction()`, or `unlearning()`

## Usage

To use this module:

1. Ensure the configuration file (`config.json`) is properly set up
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

The script will automatically determine whether to train, predict, or unlearn based on the configuration settings.
