# SISA Module Documentation

## Overview

The `sisa.py` file implements the `SISA` (Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, Aggregated) class, which is the main controller for the SISA unlearning framework in malware detection.

## Class: SISA

### Key Methods

#### preprocess

```python
def preprocess(self, purpose: str='train'):
```

Preprocesses the data for all detectors.

#### divide_data

```python
def divide_data(self):
```

Divides the dataset into training and testing sets, and further divides into shards and slices for SISA training.

#### sisa_training

```python
def sisa_training(self) -> None:
```

Performs SISA training on the divided data.

#### majority_vote

```python
def majority_vote(self, purpose: str='test'):
```

Performs majority voting for prediction or testing.

#### machine_unlearning

```python
def machine_unlearning(self):
```

Performs machine unlearning on specified data.

#### explain

```python
def explain(self):
```

Explains the model's predictions for all shards.

### Usage

The `SISA` class is the main interface for the SISA framework. It's typically used in the following way:

1. Initialize the SISA object
2. Call `divide_data()` to prepare the dataset
3. Call `sisa_training()` to train the model
4. Use `majority_vote()` for predictions
5. If needed, use `machine_unlearning()` to remove data points
6. Use `explain()` to get explanations for predictions

## Key Features

- Implements the SISA framework for machine unlearning
- Supports both ASM2Vec and SAFE-based detectors
- Provides methods for data division, training, prediction, unlearning, and explanation
- Uses a sharded and sliced approach for efficient unlearning
