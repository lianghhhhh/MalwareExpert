# MalwareExpert SAFE Module Documentation

## Overview

The `MalwareExpert_SAFE.py` file implements the `MalwareExpert_SAFE` class, which is a detector for malware using SAFE (Self-Attentive Function Embeddings) and Graph Neural Networks.

## Class: MalwareExpert_SAFE

### Key Methods

#### extractFeature

```python
def extractFeature(self, purpose: str='train') -> Any:
```

Extracts and vectorizes features from binary files using SAFE.

#### model

```python
def model(self, training: bool=True) -> Any:
```

Trains or loads the model.

#### predict

```python
def predict(self, purpose: str='test') -> np.array:
```

Makes predictions using the trained model.

#### explain

```python
def explain(self) -> Any:
```

Explains the model's predictions using GNNexplainer, edge pruning, and node pruning.

### Usage

This class is used within the SISA framework for handling SAFE-based malware detection. It's typically instantiated and used by the `SISA` class.

## Key Features

- Uses SAFE for feature extraction from binary files
- Implements a Graph Neural Network for malware classification
- Provides methods for model training, prediction, and explanation
- Integrates with the SISA framework for sharded and sliced learning
