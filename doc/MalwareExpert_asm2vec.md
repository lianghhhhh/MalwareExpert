# MalwareExpert ASM2Vec Module Documentation

## Overview

The `MalwareExpert_asm2vec.py` file implements the `MalwareExpert_asm2vec` class, which is a detector for malware using ASM2Vec and Graph Neural Networks.

## Class: MalwareExpert_asm2vec

### Key Methods

#### extractFeature

```python
def extractFeature(self, purpose: str='train') -> Any:
```

Extracts features from the dataset.

#### vectorize

```python
def vectorize(self, purpose: str='train') -> np.array:
```

Vectorizes the extracted features.

#### model

```python
def model(self, training: bool=True) -> Any:
```

Trains or loads the model.

#### predict

```python
def predict(self, purpose: str='test') -> np.array:
```

Makes predictions using the trained model.

#### explain

```python
def explain(self) -> Any:
```

Explains the model's predictions using GNNexplainer, edge pruning, and node pruning.

### Usage

This class is used within the SISA framework for handling ASM2Vec-based malware detection. It's typically instantiated and used by the `SISA` class.

## Key Features

- Uses ASM2Vec for feature extraction from assembly code
- Implements a Graph Neural Network for malware classification
- Provides methods for model training, prediction, and explanation
- Integrates with the SISA framework for sharded and sliced learning
