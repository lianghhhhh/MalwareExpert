# Instructions Converter Documentation

## Overview

The `instructions_converter.py` file defines the `InstructionsConverter` class, which is responsible for converting assembly instructions to their corresponding numerical IDs. This conversion is crucial for preparing input data for the SAFE model.

## Class: InstructionsConverter

```python
class InstructionsConverter:
```

This class handles the conversion of assembly instructions to numerical IDs.

### Initialization

```python
def __init__(self, json_i2id):
```

#### Parameters:
- `json_i2id` (str): Path to the JSON file containing the instruction-to-ID mapping.

### Methods

#### convert_to_ids

```python
def convert_to_ids(self, instructions_list):
```

Converts a list of assembly instructions to their corresponding numerical IDs.

##### Parameters:
- `instructions_list` (list): A list of assembly instruction strings to be converted.

##### Returns:
- list: A list of numerical IDs corresponding to the input instructions.

##### Process:
1. Iterates through each instruction in the input list.
2. Looks up the ID for each instruction in the `i2id` dictionary.
3. Handles unknown x86 and ARM instructions using special 'UNK' tokens.
4. Adds 1 to each ID to reserve the 0 index in the embedding matrix.

## Usage

```python
converter = InstructionsConverter("path/to/instruction_mapping.json")
instructions = ["mov eax, ebx", "push ecx", "call 0x1234"]
ids = converter.convert_to_ids(instructions)
print(ids)  # Example output: [101, 202, 303]
```

This class is essential for preprocessing assembly code before feeding it into the SAFE model, ensuring that textual instructions are properly converted to numerical representations that the model can process.
