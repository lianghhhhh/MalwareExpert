# Radare Analyzer Documentation

## Overview

The `radare_analyzer.py` file defines the `BinaryAnalyzer` class, which utilizes the radare2 reverse engineering framework to analyze binary files and extract function information.

## Class: BinaryAnalyzer

```python
class BinaryAnalyzer:
```

This class provides functionality for analyzing binary files and extracting function-related information.

### Initialization

```python
def __init__(self, path):
```

#### Parameters:
- `path` (str): Path to the binary file to be analyzed.

#### Process:
1. Opens the binary file using r2pipe.
2. Runs the "aaa" analysis command in radare2.
3. Extracts architecture and bit information from the binary.
4. Retrieves function information using the "aflj" command.

### Methods

#### get_hexasm

```python
def get_hexasm(self, address):
```

Gets the hexadecimal representation of assembly at a given address.

##### Parameters:
- `address` (int): The address to disassemble.

##### Returns:
- str: A string of hexadecimal bytes representing the assembly at the given address.

#### get_functions

```python
def get_functions(self):
```

Gets a list of all function addresses in the binary.

##### Returns:
- list: A list of unique function addresses (offsets) in the binary.

## Usage

```python
analyzer = BinaryAnalyzer("/path/to/binary")
functions = analyzer.get_functions()
for func_addr in functions:
    hex_asm = analyzer.get_hexasm(func_addr)
    print(f"Function at {func_addr}: {hex_asm}")
```

This class is crucial for extracting raw binary data and function information, which can then be further processed and analyzed using other components of the SAFE system.
